Functionalities to be implemented:
==================================

- General:
----------
* Splash Screen
* Allow user to add income and expense categories.
* There should be a projection tab as well where user can, project savings based on current budgets, salaries and recurring items.
* Add meaningful comments to the code. (low)
* Testing fragments & dialogs behavior with orientation change.


* (Showstopper)(Crash) Whenever multiple selected items are deleted, application crashes.


- Overview Fragments:
----------------------
* Rework on budget overview stuff


- Transactions detail dialog UI modification:
---------------------------------------------
* (Bug) Crash on orientation change.
	#FIXED - DialogFragment orientation change causing crash which is fixed
* IMPROVEMENT - Color scheme of the transaction detail dialog


- Transactions add dialog UI modification:
------------------------------------------
* (BUG) Crash on orientation change. 
	#FIXED - DialogFragment orientation change causing crash which is fixed

- Budget: (High):
-----------------
* (--DONE--)(FIXED)(BUG) Clicking on list items in listview is getting data from main list. 
	#FIXED state machine has been changed and now transaction details dialog opens.
* Add/Edit budget dialog update
* (--DONE--) CRASH - BUG: Orientation change of Add/Edit budget dialog crashes it.
	Root cause: application context got from getActivity was null for DB operation as well as listview creation
	Solution: In onActivityCreate(...) initial global application context is saved and is passed to DB and listView to avoid crash on orientation change. 
* (--DONE--) Show recurring period for each budget. 
* (--DONE--) Shows the budgets along with the amount allocated and amount used. 
* (--DONE--) Upon clicking the budget, it will show the transactions associated with the budget depending on the time.
* (--DONE--) Delete & Edit budget
* (--DONE--) Default budget time is one month and there is NO NONE option.
* (--Done--) Back button, open budget fragment
* (--Done--) (BUG) When budget transactions are shown and orientation is changed, view moves to budgets list.
* Test the dialog for insert and edit scenario.
* Delete budget scenario.
    Solutions: 
        1. (--Done--)(Solution) Delete only the budget and remove referece with each transaction associated with the budget. 
        2. Delete the transactions as well along with the budget.
        3. Ask the user which option they want to avail.
* Delete a transaction available in budget.
    Solutions: 
        If the transaction is deleted from within the budget fragment, only the reference of transaction to budget will be deleted. Transaction will remain there.
* (--Done--) Increase size of title.
* (--Done--) Change background of title
* Graph of budgets and compare it (Medium)
* (High)(FIXED) When a budget is deleted, all the transactions taking reference of that buget will be deleted.
* (--Done--)(FIXED)(Crash) When all the budgets are deleted, the app crash. Index array out of bound. 
	Root Cause Analysis: Reason was at the end of delete transaction we were repopulating the list and view which leads to indexes been messed up. After removing the repopulation, things went fine.
* (--Done--)(FIXED)(Crash) When a transaction is deleted budgets are deleted, the app crash. Index array out of bound. 
	Root Cause Analysis: Reason was delete action was performed on the incorrect view. Instead of deleteing a transaction in budget, app was deleting the budget itself. 
	Side-Fix: After deleting the transactions, view should remain in the transactions in budget view.
