# BeWise

This Android project was started at the end of 2014 as a personal challenge to learn and improve my Android development skills. My intentions were to create a small and personal finanace manager for Android. I didn't get much time to complete the project, so I finally decided to make this project open source.

I will add the project details and the design description as well. Anyone who likes to jump in and finish it is more than welcome.
